# _VO Epicodus Portfolio_

#### _Week 1, Friday Independent Project for Epicodus. August 3, 2018._

#### By _**Victoria Oh**_

## Description

Creation of a personal portfolio website utilizing the tools and skills learned in Week 1 of of Epicodus' _Intro to Programming_ course. I attempted to make as dynamic a page I could, incorporating the following objectives:
* The following HTML tags are all used: p, h, ul, ol, li, em, strong, a, img, div, span
* Project includes a custom-made stylesheet that uses cascading, the box model, and floats.
* Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It willâ€¦"
* The project repo contains a README that includes: author name, project name, description, setup instructions, link to GitHub Pages, and copyright info.
* Site is successfully deployed to GitHub pages.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* Required content was in place by the Friday deadline.
* Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your code with an instructor using the correct terminology.
* Bootstrap classes are used to style the page. his means explicitly using classes mentioned on this page, not just linking the Bootstrap stylesheet.
* Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indentation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
